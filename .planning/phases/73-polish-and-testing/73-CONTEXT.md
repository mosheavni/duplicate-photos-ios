# Phase 73: Polish and Testing - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Make the app ready for personal use testing. Unit tests for core algorithms (cosine similarity, connected components grouping), empty state UI when no duplicates found, and error handling for permission denied scenarios.

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion

All implementation choices delegated to Claude:

**Test coverage:**
- Which services need unit tests
- Test data approach (mock vs fixture)
- Coverage targets and test organization

**Empty state UX:**
- Messaging tone and content
- Visual treatment (illustration, icon, etc.)
- Suggested next actions if any

**Permission handling:**
- Error messaging for denied access
- Recovery flow and retry options
- Edge case handling

**Progress/feedback:**
- Progress bar implementation
- Stage indicators during scan
- Status messaging

</decisions>
